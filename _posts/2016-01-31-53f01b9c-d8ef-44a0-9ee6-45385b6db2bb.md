#### CBD, or cannabidiol, is quickly changing the debate surrounding the use of marijuana as a medicine.

Most people have heard of a chemical called THC, which is the [ingredient in marijuana][0] that gets users high. But recently, attention has shifted to another compound in marijuana called CBD --- and for good reason.

Because
while doctors can't seem to look past certain side effects of THC, CBD 
doesn't appear to present that problem. On the other hand, evidence of 
CBD's medical benefits continues to grow.

Here are five facts that you should know about this unique compound:

#### 1\. CBD is a key ingredient in cannabis

CBD is one of [over 60][1]
compounds found in cannabis that belong to a class of molecules called 
cannabinoids. Of these compounds, CBD and THC are usually present in the
highest concentrations, and are therefore the most recognized and 
studied.

CBD and THC levels tend to vary among [different plants][2]. Marijuana grown for recreational purposes often contains more THC than CBD.

However,
by using selective breeding techniques, cannabis breeders have managed 
to create varieties with high levels of CBD and next to zero levels of 
THC. These strains are rare but have become [more popular][3] in recent years.

#### 2\. CBD is non-psychoactive

Unlike
THC, CBD does not cause a high. While this makes CBD a poor choice for 
recreational users, it gives the chemical a significant advantage as a 
medicine, since health professionals prefer treatments with minimal side
effects.

CBD is non-psychoactive because it [does not][4]
act on the same pathways as THC. These pathways, called CB1 receptors, 
are highly concentrated in the brain and are responsible for the 
mind-altering effects of THC.

A 2011 review published in [Current Drug Safety][5]
concludes that CBD "does not interfere with several psychomotor and 
psychological functions." The authors add that several studies suggest 
that CBD is "well tolerated and safe" even at high doses.

#### 3\. CBD has a wide range of medical benefits

Although
CBD and THC act on different pathways of the body, they seem to have 
many of the same medical benefits. According to a 2013 review published 
in the [British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology][6], studies have found CBD to possess the following medical properties:
